# assignment steps ##
To implement the backend API with User, Blog and Comment models, we can use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL. In this example, we will be using PostgreSQL. To implement the solution using Node.js, we will use the following technologies:

Express.js for creating RESTful APIs
PostgreSQL for storing the data
Sequelize ORM for database modeling and querying


Step 1
We will start by creating a new Node.js project using npm init. 

Step 2
We will also create a new file called .env to store our environment variables. 

Step 3
We will create a new PostgreSQL database.

Step 4
We will create the required tables.

Step 5
We will create three models using Sequelize: User, Blog, and Comment.

Step 6
We will create a new file called db.js that will be responsible for establishing the database connection and loading the models.
